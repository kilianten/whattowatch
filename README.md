WhatToWatch

A very primitive website that I did outside of college. I really like the idea of generating a movie idea for people who can't decide what they want to watch.
I used HTML, CSS & javascript to achieve what I wanted for the website to work. As this was very early on in my studies, its very basic and lacking in functionality. I am very passionate about websites and movies so I really enjoyed creating this. I actually had it online at one point at www.whattowatch.ie but it was mostly to see how it would work so I have since taken it down.
